HD-eXplosion is a straightforward tool for visualizing HDX data. It can be used to create
chiclet and volcano plots with or without a statistical filter applied. It can also extract a
list of peptides that are shared between multiple HDX experiments post-processing.

If you use HD-eXplosion please acknowledge Naifu Zhang and Sheena Dâ€™Arcy of The University of Texas at Dallas.
